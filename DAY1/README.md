# DAY1 - DSA Practice

A collection of small C++ practice programs (ADD, checkevenodd, hello, sumofNO, findlargest).

This repository was initialized by an automated assistant to enable Git SCM in the workspace.

Notes:
- Build with your preferred C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ *.cpp -o program`.
- `.gitignore` excludes common build artifacts and macOS dSYM files.
